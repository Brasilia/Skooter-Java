# Skooter-Java

(2016)

An OOP project made much above quality specifications for an undergrad class

I had to implement, along with some extra features, the first levels of Bytebusters' Skooter game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSrHua585qg

There was some code to get started from but it wasn't good for a game so I wrote it from scratch, following a tutorial for the core of the game engine in Java, which is indicated in each source file that used any code from it. The tutorial is, unfortunately, no longer available at http://abrindoojogo.com.br/djjindex

All images, except player and "monster" sprites, which were removed (replaced by arrows) to avoid any licensing matter, were made by myself using GIMP.
